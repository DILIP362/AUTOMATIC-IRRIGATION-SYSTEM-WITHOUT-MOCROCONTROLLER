Soil Moisture Sensor–Based Automatic Switch

Low-Cost, Microcontroller-Free Automation | Practical Electronics and IoT Skills

This project demonstrates a fully analog automatic switching system using a soil moisture sensor and a transistor.
It highlights hands-on electronics, transistor switching, and voltage regulation without programming or microcontrollers — perfect for cost-effective IoT or smart garden solutions.

Automatic Output Control: 
 Turns ON or OFF a device (LED, relay, or motor) based on soil moisture.

Skills Demonstrated: 
Analog sensing, transistor switching, circuit design, low-cost prototyping.

Real-World Application: 
Can be extended to automatic irrigation systems, smart home control, or environmental monitoring.

Components Used
Component	Qty	Description
9V Battery	1	Power supply
7805 Voltage Regulator (5V)	1	Provides stable voltage to the sensor
Soil Moisture Sensor Module	1	Detects soil wetness
NPN Transistor (BC547 / 2N2222)	1	Acts as a switch for the load
LED (or Relay/Motor)	1	Visual indicator or actuator
Jumper Wires	—	For connections
Circuit and Working

Dry soil → High resistance → Low sensor output → Transistor ON → Output active

Wet soil → Low resistance → High sensor output → Transistor OFF → Output inactive

The 7805 voltage regulator ensures a stable 5V supply for the sensor from a 9V battery.

Key Concept: The transistor functions as an automatic switch, eliminating the need for programming or microcontrollers.
